# TinyML-Words-Classifier
[Embedded Machine Learning (TinyML) ](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/what-is-embedded-machine-learning-anyway) on [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense) using Edge Impulse. [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/our-story) is the leading development platform for machine learning on edge devices, free for developers and trusted by enterprises.

You will build a ML model in Edge Impulse Studio and deploy it to your microcontroller device to develop a single word speech recognition system. In this repo, it can recognized the words "Yes", "No", "On", and "Off".

In able to do this, you will need to do the following steps. For more details click [this](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense).
1. Create your [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/#:~:text=Edge%20Impulse%20is%20the%20leading,developers%20and%20trusted%20by%20enterprises.) account.
2. Setup the required software on your computer.
   You will need to install the following software:
   -  [Node.js v12.xx](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher.
   -  [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/installation/). This is how you [install Arduino CLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jMWsFER-Bc) on Windows 10.
   -  Install the [Edge Impulse CLI](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/cli-installation) by opening a command prompt or terminal and run
      ```
                      npm install -g edge-impulse-cli
      ```
3. Prepapre your datasets, download the [prebuilt dataset](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/keyword-spotting) Keyword spotting from Edge Impulse documentation, and [Speech Commands Dataset](http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz) from Google AI. Extract the files on the folder.

4. Upload your single word voice or speech dataset to your Edge Impulse project. You are free to choose which words are going to use.
   -  Connect your local computer to Edge Impulse studio. Open your command prompt, and run
      ```
                      edge-impulse-daemon
      ```
      Input your account credentials and select a project, if you have a prevous project, switch the connection to your new project, clear the Edge Impulse daemon configuration by the running the command
      ```
                      edge-impulse-daemon --clean
      ```
   -  Upload your existing datasets to your Edge Impulse project. There are two methods to [upload](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/cli-uploader) your datasets, first go to the **Data acquisition** and click the *upload* icon. You can select files (*.wav* file format), the *category* and the *label* directly from Edge Impulse Studio.

      The other method is uploading via command prompt. This method is reliable and faster of uploading a large number of datasets. If you want to use **Off** dataset, run the command
      ```
                      edge-impulse-uploader --label Off C:\Users\Path\to\a\file\Off\*.wav
      ```

      Upload your desired keywords from Google AI dataset, and noise dataset from Edge Impulse prebuilt dataset. Approximately, about thousand words or data is enough for each dataset.
      
5. With the data set in place you can design an impulse. In the Studio, go to the **Create impulse tab**, add a Time series data, an Audio (MFCC) and a Neural Network (Keras) block. Leave the window size to 1 second (as that's the length of our audio samples in the dataset) and click Save Impulse. For more details, visit the [**Responding to your voice**](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/responding-to-your-voice) tutorial.

6. Before training your neural network model, we'll need to generate *Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient* (MFCC) blocks to extract the audio features and classify it. To do this, click the **Generate features** button at the top of the page, then click the **green Generate features** button. This will take a minute or so to complete. Afterwards you will see a 3D representation showing your complete dataset, with each data-item color-coded to its respective label. This is a usefull tool to find anomalies (an item that's in a wrong cluster), and to validate whether your dataset is suitable for ML (it should separate nicely).

7. Train your Neural Network model. Neural networks are algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that can learn to recognize patterns that appear in their training data. The network that we're training here will take the MFCC as an input, and try to map this to one of five classes; your keywords ("Yes", "No", "On", and "Off") and Noise.
   -  Click on **NN Classifier** under **Impulse design** tab.
   -  Before you begin training, you can configure the number of training cycles (epochs), learning rate, and confidence rating. Increasing the number of epochs may increase the accuracy, too many epochs may cause your model to over-fit the training data (the model does not learn the data, it memorizes the data). You have to find the accuracy of validation data for each epoch or maybe iteration to investigate whether it over-fits or not. You should stop training when the error rate of validation data is minimum.
   -  In the **Neural network architecture**, you can play around with the number of neurons and network, it may increase the accuracy of the model but doesn't guarantee it. The more complex the model, it takes more time to learn, and more device memory to be needed.
   -  Train your neural network model, after training, look for the performance of your ML model.

8. Test your ML model
   -  Go to your **Dashboard**, at the lower section, click **Rebalance dataset** and type *rebalace dataset* to confirm. Now to have a dataset for testing purpose.
   -  Go to **Model testing**, select all the datasets and classify it. After running it, you may see your model performance.

      ![alt tag](https://github.com/TronixLab/TinyML-Words-Classifier/blob/main/results/testResults.jpg?raw=true)
   
   -  You can also test it in the **Live classification**. You need to connect first your Arduino device to Edge Impulse API. Click [this](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) for more info.

9. Deploy the ML model in your Arduino device. This will export the impulse, and build a binary or Arduino Library without dependencies that will run on your development board in a single step.
   -  To export your model, click on **Deployment** tab. Optimize the model can increase on-device performance but may reduce accuracy.

   -  Build your model either in Arduino Library or in binary file and extract it. If you were using Arduino Library, add it to your Arduino IDE library, Go to **File** > **Examples** and find your Edge Impulse project Arduino Library, and choose *arduino_nano_33_ble_sense_accelerometer_continues*. Upload the Arduino sketch, then open your IDE serial monitor.

      You may encounter compilinng error in your Arduino IDE. In my case, I encountered an error that shows
      ```
      fork/exec C:\Users\MYUSER\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\arduino\tools\arm-none-eabi-gcc\7-2017q4/bin/arm-none-eabi-g++.exe: The filename or extension is too long.
      ```
      To fix this issue, download the [platform.local.txt](http://cdn.edgeimpulse.com/drivers/platform.local.txt) and copy this file under the Arduino mbed directory (e.g.)
      ```
      C:\Users\MYUSER\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\arduino\hardware\mbed\1.1.4\
      ```
      
   -  Uploading firmware in bin file format is much faster than using Arduino IDE for actual testing. To do this, if your are using Windows 10 OS, first double press on the reset push button quickly to launch the bootloader. The on-board LED should start pulsating to indicate this.

      Your Arduino is ready to flash the firmware. To flash the Arduino binary file firmware, run the *flash_windows.bat* file. 
      
      ![alt tag](https://github.com/TronixLab/TinyML-Words-Classifier/blob/main/results/fashBinFirmware.jpg?raw=true)      
      
      To run the the firmware, run the command
      ```
                      edge-impulse-run-impulse --continuous
      ```
      ![alt tag](https://github.com/TronixLab/TinyML-Words-Classifier/blob/main/results/runBinFirmware.jpg?raw=true)      
      
      **Viola! You have now deploy a embedded machine learning on Arduino.**
